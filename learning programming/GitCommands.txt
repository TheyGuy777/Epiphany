Here are few  git basic commands to get started with.

Assuming you have already created a repo on the GitHub, now you will have to launch a command line interface in the desired folder and perform the following command to clone your repo:
	-> git clone <your-repo-url>
After cloning is done, you will now have to initial stuff or create new directories or create new files 
	-> create a directory in windows shell 
		mkdir <directory-name>
	-> create a file 
		echo <text-to-be-included in the file> your-file-name.txt
	-> launch a txt file from cmd 
		notepad your-file-name.txt //caution this file will be saved on the directory you are currently working in 

After making the initial changes simply add the changes to the repo 
	-> git add . // to save all the current changes to the files 
and then, commit the changes you have made
	-> git commit -m "Your Message for description"
after which if you have git accounts set up at your pc you will simply have to push the changes from this local repo to the repo hosted on GitHub 
	-> git push origin main

Thats all for setting up the repository, now all you have to do is add content and be consistent. 
Happy Learning.
